       1) Primitive data types contain just values, non-primitive data types contain value + method
       2) Primitive data type names use just lowercase characters, but non-primitive data types names use uppercase at the beginning
       3) Primitive data types were created by Java, developers cannot create primitive data types
          But non-primitive data types can be created by Java and by any developer
       4) Non-primitive data types use same size area in memory but primitive data types use different size area in memory
